# i8080emu

## About

This is an emulator for the 8-bit [Intel 8080](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080)
microprocessor from the 1970s. This emulator passes a comprehensive suite of
tests that you can use to verify its equivalence with a real Intel 8080 chip.

## Build

You will need [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
installed on your machine to build the emulator from source. Once you've cloned
the repository, navigate to its root directory and run the following command:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

## Run

If you have a program compiled for the Intel 8080, this emulater will be able
to run it using the `run` command:

```sh
i8080emu run /path-to-program/program.COM
```

## Test

You will need to download the tests before you can run them. If you have `curl`
installed on your machine, you can download the tests with the following
command:

```sh
curl \
-O https://altairclone.com/downloads/cpu_tests/8080PRE.COM \
-O https://altairclone.com/downloads/cpu_tests/TST8080.COM \
-O https://altairclone.com/downloads/cpu_tests/CPUTEST.COM \
-O https://altairclone.com/downloads/cpu_tests/8080EXM.COM
```

Then, run a test of your choosing with the `run` command:

```sh
i8080emu run CPUTEST.COM
```

Any printing during the course of the program's execution will be directed to
your terminal's standard output:

```text
DIAGNOSTICS II V1.2 - CPU TEST
COPYRIGHT (C) 1981 - SUPERSOFT ASSOCIATES

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
CPU IS 8080/8085
BEGIN TIMING TEST
END TIMING TEST
CPU TESTS OK
```

The longest test suite is `8080EXM.COM`, which takes around 30 minutes to run.
The other test files only take a few seconds each.
