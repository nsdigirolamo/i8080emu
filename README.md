# i8080emu

## About

A work-in-progress emulator for the 8-bit [Intel 8080](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080)
microprocessor from the 1970s. To verify this emulator's correctness I'm
currently using a test suite created by Frank D. Cringle and modified by
Ian Bartholomew that you can find [here](https://altairclone.com/downloads/cpu_tests/).

## Build

You will need [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
installed on your machine to build the emulator from source. Once you've cloned
the repository, navigate to its root directory and run the following command:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

## Run

To run a program on the emulator, use the `run` command followed by the path
to the program:

```sh
i8080emu run /path-to-program/program.COM
```

## Test

You will need to download the tests before you can run them. If you have `curl`
installed on your machine, you can download the tests with the following
command:

```sh
curl \
-O https://altairclone.com/downloads/cpu_tests/8080PRE.COM \
-O https://altairclone.com/downloads/cpu_tests/TST8080.COM \
-O https://altairclone.com/downloads/cpu_tests/CPUTEST.COM \
-O https://altairclone.com/downloads/cpu_tests/8080EXM.COM
```

Then, run a test as outlined above:

```sh
i8080emu run 8080PRE.COM
```

The longest test suite is `8080EXM.COM`, which takes around 25 minutes to run.
The other suites should only take a few seconds each.
