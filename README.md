# i8080emu

## About

A work-in-progress emulator for the 8-bit [Intel 8080](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080)
microprocessor from the 1970s. To verify this emulator's correctness I'm
currently using a test suite created by Frank D. Cringle and modified by
Ian Bartholomew that you can find [here](https://altairclone.com/downloads/cpu_tests/).
